ProjectIrrationalMondriaan
==========================

This project was writen more than 6 years ago as an exploration of what I could do with the Processing.org enviroment.

Since I upgraded to Yosemite a lot of old Processing sketches broke, rather than fixing the problem I wanted to do a complete rewrite (JAVA is dead?).

===========================

The Irrational Mondriaan series is an exploration of how willing viewers are to interact with these interactive paintings. 

I don't see the paintings as the art, but the reactions of the public. How do they deal with their own conflicts between rationality and urge of irrationality (or otherway around). How does the exhibition room look with only introvert people in it? How does the same exhibition room look full with extraverted people? How does a mix of people look?

The paintings in rest are digital reproductions of Mondriaan paintings. I choose Mondriaan paintings because to me they have a philopsophy to 'deconstruct' a composition to it's fundamentals. Horizontals, verticals, if color is used it's just a minimal pallet of reds, yellows and blues. I perceive these paintings as a pure 'rational' modus operandi.

(Painting at 'rest')

What these video paintings do is giving the viewer the opportunity to counter act this rationality with irrationalty (yelling at the painting, punching the painting, dance in front the painting) to show what maybe could have been. How far is the viewer willing to go?

If the artist writes a interactive painting that hooks into biometric sensor array's installed on two viewers, and you only get to see the full effect of the painting when one of those sensors array's doesn't send any signals anymore. Is the addience prepared to go so far to "kill" the signals of a sensor array, is the artist willing to go that far?

(This specific painitng is vision reactive. The lines on the white (gray) background move. The movements is controlled by the viewer via webcam. The sensitivity can be set so that the viewer needs to use her/his whole body to achief a tiny movement)

In a related series (still as Processing sketch) I have a 'Who's afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue' by Barnett Newman where the viewer can take a virtual knife to the canvas. 

This project is meant as a template to rewrite all of my Irrational Mondriaan series and related series.

I try to integrate OSC (http://opensoundcontrol.org) communications with these video paintings. 

Written and only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, Xcode 6.1 and I used a Nightly Build openFrameworks (wanted to test some new upcoming functionality)
