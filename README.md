The Irrational Mondriaan series is an exploration of how willing viewers are to interact with interactive paintings.

The paintings in rest are digital reproductions of Mondriaan paintings. I choose Mondriaan paintings because to me they have a philopsophy to 'deconstruct' a composition to it's fundamentals. Horizontals, verticals, if color is used it's just a minimal pallet of reds, yellows and blues. I prperceivehese paintings as a pure 'rational' modus opoperandi

What these video paintings do is giving the viewer the opopportunityo influence this rationality with irirrationallyyelling at the painting, punching the painting, dance inin frontf the painting) to show what maybe could have been. How far is the viewer willing to go?

In a related series (still as processing sketch) I have a 'Who's afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue' where the viewer can take a virtual knife to the canvas. 

This project is meant as a template to rewrite all of my Irrational Mondriaan series and related series.

I try to inintegrateSC (http://opensoundcontrol.org) communications with these video paintings. 

Written and only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, Xcode 6.1 and I used a Nightly Build openFrameworks (wanted to test some new upcoming functionality)
