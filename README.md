ProjectIrrationalMondriaan
==========================

This project was writen more than 6 years ago as an exploration of what I could do with it in the Processing.org enviroment.

Since I upgraded to Yosemite a lot of old Processing sketches broke, rather than fixing the problem I wanted to do a complete rewrite (JAVA is dead?).

===========================

The Irrational Mondriaan series is an exploration of how willing viewers are to interact with interactive paintings.

The paintings in rest are digital reproductions of Mondriaan paintings. I choose Mondriaan paintings because to me they have a philopsophy to 'deconstruct' a composition to it's fundamentals. Horizontals, verticals, if color is used it's just a minimal pallet of reds, yellows and blues. I perceive these paintings as a pure 'rational' modus operandi.

What these video paintings do is giving the viewer the opopportunity to counter act this rationality with irrationalty (yelling at the painting, punching the painting, dance in front the painting) to show what maybe could have been. How far is the viewer willing to go?

(This specific painitng is sound reactive. The Red in the middle will appear with small volume, The CMY dots need far more volume to 'grow'. As a 'reward' for the viewer the CMY colors will mix when the 'grow' to a size that they overlap things)

In a related series (still as Processing sketch) I have a 'Who's afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue' where the viewer can take a virtual knife to the canvas. 

This project is meant as a template to rewrite all of my Irrational Mondriaan series and related series.

I try to integrate OSC (http://opensoundcontrol.org) communications with these video paintings. 

Written and only tested with Mac OS X Yosemite, Xcode 6.1 and I used a Nightly Build openFrameworks (wanted to test some new upcoming functionality)
